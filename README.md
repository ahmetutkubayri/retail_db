# Retail Data Analysis with PySpark

This project analyzes retail data, including customer orders, product details, and categories. The primary objective is to perform data processing, count unique orders, and summarize dataset characteristics. This analysis is conducted using PySpark for efficient handling of large datasets.

## Project Structure
- **Data Loading**: Reads CSV files into PySpark DataFrames for analysis.
- **Data Processing**: Counts total records and unique order IDs for initial insights into order patterns.
- **Conclusion**: Summarizes key findings and suggests directions for further analysis.

## Dataset Descriptions
- `orders.csv`: Contains customer orders with order details and timestamps.
- `order_items.csv`: Includes item-level details for each order.
- `products.csv`: Lists product details available in the store.
- `customers.csv`: Contains customer data.
- `categories.csv`: Provides categories for each product.
- `departments.csv`: Department data for organizing products.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides foundational insights into retail data, including order volume, unique order counts, and product information. Future analyses could expand on this by examining customer trends, sales patterns by department, and category-based performance.
